Codes for data operations like Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, and Exploratory Data Analysis
The insurance.csv dataset is the main subject of the insuranceEDA script's analysis.
It imports a number of libraries, including stats from scipy, norm from scipy, StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing, seaborn, numpy, and pandas from scipy.
After loading, the dataset is examined for missing values.
The script provides a scatterplot of the dataset's variables as well as a correlation matrix, a descriptive statistical description of the dataset, univariate analysis of the dataset, standardization of the charges variable, and bivariate analysis of charges/age.




The fitting of a linear regression model to the insurance data is the primary goal of the Linear Regression script. 
The dataset is loaded after the required libraries are imported. 
The script then encodes categorical data and uses a correlation matrix to show the data.
The dataset is divided into training and test data, and the training data is used to fit the multiple linear regression.
The program forecasts test results and assesses the model using R squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
