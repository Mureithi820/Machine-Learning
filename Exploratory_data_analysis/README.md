#  Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

## Description

#### Variables in the dataset

Age, sex, bmi, region, children, region, 
smoker: whether the individual is a smoker or not, 
charges: the cost of insurance for the individual.

### Steps followed
* Examine the dataset's form to estimate the number of rows and columns 
* Look for missing values and manage them properly

* Check the data types of the variables to ensure they are in the correct format 
* Summarize the statistics of the numerical variables
* Visualize the distribution of the variables using histograms, density plots, and box plots 
* Check the data types of the variables to ensure they are in the correct format 

### Insights gained after the analysis

* The dataset's shape is (1338, 7) and the number of missing values is 0: this means that there are no missing values and that the dataset has 1338 rows and 7 columns, with each row containing values for all 7 variables.
* There are no missing numbers, which makes it easier to analyze and derive insights from the data. * Age: The customers' ages range from 18 to 64, with a mean of 39 years. The age standard deviation is 14 years, showing that the ages span a wide range.

* BMI: The consumers' BMI ranged from 15.96 to 53.13, with a mean of 30.66. The BMI standard deviation is 6.10, indicating that the BMIs are normal.

* Children: The customers range from 0 to 5, with a mean of 1.09. The standard deviation of children is 1.21, showing that the number of children varies greatly.

* Charges: The charges for insurance range from 1121.87 to 63770.43 with a mean of 13270.42. The standard deviation of charges is 12110.01, indicating that insurance charges vary widely.
### conclusion
* The exploratory data analysis indicates that each numerical variable has a wide range of values, indicating that there may be considerable disparities between clients.
