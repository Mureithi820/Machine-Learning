# Machine-Learning
### Variables:


insurance.csv is a data set.
Stats from scipy, norm from scipy, StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing, seaborn, numpy, and pandas from scipy were all imported.
Data manipulation: Exploratory Data Analysis, Logistic Regression, and Linear Regression (EDA)
Charges are a dependent variable.
Age, gender, BMI, children, smoker, and region are all independent variables.

### The following steps were taken:

*Analyzing Exploratory Data:

*Import the necessary libraries and load the insurance.

*Dataset in CSV format.
*Encrypt categorical data and display it using a correlation matrix.
*Split the dataset into two parts: training and testing.
*Fit a multivariate linear regression model using the training data.
*Forecast test results using the model.
*R squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) are all used to evaluate the model (RMSE).

### Following the analysis, the following conclusions were reached:
*Age and smoking status are both positively connected to charges.
*Smokers face far harsher penalties than nonsmokers.
*Costs rise in direct proportion to BMI.
*There is no discernible difference in charges based on gender or area.
*The multiple linear regression model fits well and can be utilized to create accurate charge forecasts.

###  Conclusion 
Exploratory Data Analysis and Linear Regression were used to analyze the insurance.csv dataset. According to the findings, charges are positively associated to age, smoking status, and Obesity. The multiple linear regression model fit well and appropriately predicted charges.
